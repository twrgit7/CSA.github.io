## Submit VM

- Do `not` use `content` on the VM that may `offend` other `people`.
- Do `not` use an `external URL` to resolve the VM (If the link does not work, the machine would be unsolvable.).
- The VM does `not` have to have a `graphical interface "GUI"` (Unless necessary to resolve the VM).
- `Delete` or `redirect` any `history` files to `/dev/null` (Unless necessary to resolve the VM).
- The VM has to have a logic from the beginning to the end.
- The creator has to test the VM to avoid possible bugs.
- The VM has to work correctly in `VirtualBox`.
- The VM must have the `flags`: (`user.txt` & `root.txt`) located in `/home/[user]/user.txt` & `/root/root.txt`.
- To keep a consistency over the machines, flags must be a `md5` string.
- If the VM requires a `brute force attack`, enter a `password` that does `not exceed the first 5000 lines` of `rockyou.txt` (To avoid unnecessary long waits).
- If the VM requires a `domain`/`subdomain` it has to be `.nyx` (example: `domain.nyx`/`subdomain.domain.nyx`).
- We do `not accept VM` that are on `other platforms` (The only reason is because we want to have our own machines).

## Submit Writeups

- Do `not show` the `user.txt` & `root.txt` flags.
